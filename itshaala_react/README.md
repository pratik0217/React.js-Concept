# JSX & Component in React
React is built using JSX & Components. Letâ€™s break them down and understand how they work!

# What is JSX
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a special syntax in React that looks like HTML but works inside JavaScript. It makes UI code cleaner, readable, and more efficient.

### ðŸŽ¯ Why JSX?
âœ… **Looks Like HTML** â€“ But it's inside JavaScript! <br>
âœ… **Faster Rendering** â€“ React optimizes it behind the scenes. <br>
âœ… **Safer** â€“ Prevents XSS attacks by escaping values.
