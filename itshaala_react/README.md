# React.js App code flow
- First of all, run the HTML file code then script file load the main.jsx file.
- HTML file have only two element first element div#root and 2nd element script.
- All project code render in div#root.

# File & Folder structure of react app
- package.json is most important file. If package.json file are not existed then project are not properly run.
- package-lock.json similer to the package.json. if changes in package.json then automatically changing in package-lock.json.
- gitigonre this is use for important file not push on github.

# JSX & Component in React
React is built using JSX & Components. Letâ€™s break them down and understand how they work!

# What is JSX
- JSX stand for JavaScript Syntax Extension or JavaScript XML.
- JSX allows to the HTML tags written in JavaScript.

- JSX (JavaScript XML) is a special syntax in React that looks like HTML but works inside JavaScript. It makes UI code cleaner, readable, and more efficient.

# Without using JSX in React.

Final code -

### ðŸŽ¯ Why JSX?
âœ… **Looks Like HTML** â€“ But it's inside JavaScript! <br>
âœ… **Faster Rendering** â€“ React optimizes it behind the scenes. <br>
âœ… **Safer** â€“ Prevents XSS attacks by escaping values.

### ðŸ›  Example of JSX
<img width="663" height="77" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-19 204204" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01a09367-3be4-42d7-9069-e2b48603c059" />

ðŸ”¹ This looks like HTML, but itâ€™s actually JavaScript!

# Interview Question
Q What is JSX ?

Ans - JSX stand for JavaScript Syntax Extension and also Know as JavaScript XML

# React Component
<img width="1211" height="551" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-20 155651" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b23fe2d8-0e96-4677-aee7-ff23107b3bfe" />
<img width="1213" height="422" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-20 155712" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fd7bd5a-7fe0-493b-afa7-eb714319d0e0" />
- create project then project divided into multiple section(Part).
<img width="1682" height="815" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-20 160003" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aab455e6-583a-4fdc-999b-b867da0743c4" />
- Component always declare in first letter in captical format.

# Export and Import React
<img width="1338" height="653" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-20 160827" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f3c60ad-fb48-4523-bc4b-ec2bf1add5ee" />
export - send the component file to excuting also importing in App.jsx
import - Recive the file of sending exported file.

# Export default & Export react
- export default component one time use and this export default component import (componentName) from 'component file location'
<img width="651" height="458" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-20 165344" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4b21f0f-38c1-47db-a123-146fb4498049" />

- export use for multiple componemnt render in main App.jsx import {componentName} from 'file location'
<img width="884" height="667" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-20 165255" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/296ec9a1-06d6-4072-897b-5abc9d7ebe86" />

- this way import of export default & export component file.
<img width="851" height="62" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-20 165325" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47909941-1124-43a9-8988-b096c6b80806" />

Note - Not required only use component are export. they are also exporting variable.
     - Exported Component/Variable declare {...}

# Click Event and Function call
<img width="1222" height="588" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-20 215640" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81c8a306-6bad-4798-94fc-fcbde441277f" />

- Event always write in camelCase format for React function.
- Event not requried write in camelCase for JavaScript(JS) function.
<img width="805" height="241" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-20 225011" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/265e2050-3c95-4232-a58e-d8c64f7a0adf" />

- function call {functionName()} as this way then showing error and automatically run in React but function call using function defination {functionName} this way then successfully run.
Call Arrow function/function passing parameter :-
- Syntax :-

Interview Question - 

Q) Why automatically calling function ?

Ans - Because if calling function using Braces as JS format {functionName()} in react then calling automatically function.
    - Solution is always remember if calling function in react then use function defination {functionName} for function calling in React.

# Upgrade React version
<img width="1279" height="496" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-20 230119" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40b1a7f5-ee23-4879-b804-ec4ccf663d04" />

Check current version in React
- Click on the package.json then searching dependencies they have version of react and also react-dom version.
- Dependencies have a current version of react & react-dom.
<img width="650" height="76" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-20 232335" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8ff1488-8595-43cc-b636-a8793994ed06" />

- Then update to latest version of react & react-dom in package.json (dependencies) and also automatically updated package-lock.json file.

<img width="1458" height="648" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-20 235134" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2a9835c-bd21-43be-8eae-457e4aa67c34" />


Why state requried :-  
- If change the value and re-render on web browser(UI) they use State.
- Can the use variable through value change but chenging value not re-render in Web browser.

What is State :- 
- State is container to store data like variable.
- this is mutable and dynamic.
- We have to import it when we want to use it.
- It re-render component automatically so that data can visible on UI.

What is State :- 
- Hooks are the special feature of functional component.
- Hooks let you see different react feature from your components.
               - States
               - Life cycle methods
               - Side effects etc.

  How to check hook :-
  - If you see use in starting of the word in react then called as Hooks
  Example - {useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.}

Syntax State :-
