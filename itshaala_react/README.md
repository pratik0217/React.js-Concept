# React.js App code flow
- First of all, run the HTML file code then script file load the main.jsx file.
- HTML file have only two element first element div#root and 2nd element script.
- All project code render in div#root.

# File & Folder structure of react app
- package.json is most important file. If package.json file are not existed then project are not properly run.
- package-lock.json similer to the package.json. if changes in package.json then automatically changing in package-lock.json.
- gitigonre this is use for important file not push on github.

# JSX & Component in React
React is built using JSX & Components. Letâ€™s break them down and understand how they work!

# What is JSX
- JSX stand for JavaScript Syntax Extension or JavaScript XML.
- JSX allows to the HTML tags written in JavaScript.

- JSX (JavaScript XML) is a special syntax in React that looks like HTML but works inside JavaScript. It makes UI code cleaner, readable, and more efficient.

### ðŸŽ¯ Why JSX?
âœ… **Looks Like HTML** â€“ But it's inside JavaScript! <br>
âœ… **Faster Rendering** â€“ React optimizes it behind the scenes. <br>
âœ… **Safer** â€“ Prevents XSS attacks by escaping values.

### ðŸ›  Example of JSX

ðŸ”¹ This looks like HTML, but itâ€™s actually JavaScript!

# React Component
<img width="1211" height="551" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-20 155651" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b23fe2d8-0e96-4677-aee7-ff23107b3bfe" />

# Export and Import React
<img width="1338" height="653" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-20 160827" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f3c60ad-fb48-4523-bc4b-ec2bf1add5ee" />
export - send the component file to excuting also importing in App.jsx
import - Recive the file of sending exported file.

# Export default & Export react
- export default component one time use and this export default component import (componentName) from 'component file location'
<img width="651" height="458" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-20 165344" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4b21f0f-38c1-47db-a123-146fb4498049" />

- export use for multiple componemnt render in main App.jsx import {componentName} from 'file location'
<img width="884" height="667" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-20 165255" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/296ec9a1-06d6-4072-897b-5abc9d7ebe86" />

- this way import of export default & export component file.
